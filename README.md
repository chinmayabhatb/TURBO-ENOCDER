Madhekar, "Implementation of Turbo decoder using MAX-LOGMAP algorithm in VHDL," 2015 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON), New Delhi, 2015, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443180.Abstract: Design and implementation of a Turbo decoder on FPGA is a challenging task. Various algorithms based on the BCJR algorithm have been proposed to enable the implementation of Turbo decoding in a hardware device. With the advent of FPGAs, the realization of the BCJR algorithm and different simplified versions of BCJR algorithm on hardware is possible. A VHDL implementation of Turbo decoder using the MAX-LOG-MAP algorithm has been discussed in this paper. The target device used for this implementation is Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. Simulation and synthesis were carried out using ModelSim SE 6.1 and Xilinx ISE 10.1. BER plots and input and output waveforms for interleaver, deinterleaver, MAX-LOG-MAP decoder and Turbo decoder are also presented. keywords: {error statistics;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;interleaved codes;maximum likelihood decoding;radiocommunication;turbo codes;turbo decoder implementation;turbo decoder design;BCJR algorithm;hardware device;VHDL implementation;Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA implementation;ModelSim SE 6.1;Xilinx ISE 10.1;BER plot;interleaver;deinterleaver;MAX-LOG-MAP decoder algorithm;bit error rate;maximum a posteriori algorithm;Decoding;Bit error rate;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Field programmable gate arrays;Turbo codes;Error correcting codes;Turbo codes;iterative decoding;FPGA;MAX-LOG-MAP algorithm},URL:Â https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7443180&isnumber=7443105
